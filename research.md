### Our Research

**The significance of lysosomes in the cardiac disease pathology**

The ultimate goal of our research is to understand the process that promotes cardiomyocyte injury or loss that eventually leads to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. The Autophagy-Lysosome system plays a key role in protecting the heart and maintaining its contractile function. Dysregulation of this system leads to intracellular Ca2+ dysregulation, increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury, apoptosis and overall cardiac dysfunction. Recent studies have demonstrated an association between cardiac injury and lysosomal dysfunction. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) occurs in response to a variety of stresses that promote the release of lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin D (CTSD) from the lysosomal lumen into the cytosol where these enzymes then participate in apoptotic signaling. Elucidating the spatiotemporal regulation of these intracellular events will help to delineate the essential processes that are necessary for maintaining cardiac muscle cell homeostasis. Understanding this regulation will allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent cardiac dysfunction under various stresses.


#### Project: 

1. **Lysosomal dysfunction in the diabetic heart**

We will investigate the pathological significance of LMP and CTSD in the diabetic heart injury using pharmacological and genetic gain- and loss-of-function approaches in both in vitro cultured cells and in vivo mouse models. Successful completion of this project will provide novel insight into the mechanisms that mediate diabetic cardiac injury, thus facilitating drug design for preventing or treating cardiomyopathy and heart failure in diabetes.
